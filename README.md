# ILRI GNU/Linux Mirrors

Officially unofficial mirrors for various GNU/Linux package repositories. Hosted in Nairobi, Kenya. Born out of personal/institutional necessity, offered to the community. When traffic is local (ie using KENET, Jamii, Zuku, etc) the speeds are several orders of magnitude faster than mirrors in the US, Europe, etc.

Faster updates, less international traffic, and giving something back to the community â€” everybody wins!
